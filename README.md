# AdamRaichu's Structures

A vanilla+ data pack containing structures which give the game a little bit more character.

## Features

All structures will (eventually; this is a WIP) have a book with associated lore explaining what they are and why they are there. Copies of the lore can be found in dropdowns below.

### Villager Graveyards
