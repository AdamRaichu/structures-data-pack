# AdamRaichu's Structures

A vanilla+ data pack containing structures which give the game a little bit more character.

> Have any suggestions for new features? Found a mistake? Have any ideas for improving existing content? Please [create an issue](https://github.com/AdamRaichu/structures-data-pack/issues) and I'll take a look.

## Features

All structures will (eventually; this is a WIP) have a book with associated lore explaining what they are and why they are there. Copies of the lore can be found in dropdowns below.

### Villager Graveyards

<details>
  <summary>Lore</summary>

Villagers die in much the same way that people do. When a citizen dies and they are able to collect the body, they bring it to one of the graveyards scattered across the world. Unfortunately, the sanctity of the dead is not something evil respects....

**Mausoleums**. Some particularly wealthy villagers paid to have mausoleums built for their remains. Sometimes, even a wandering trader has been given a plot for one, although their architectural tastes are... unusual.

**Technical Information**. The following is technical information regarding drop and generation rates, which some may consider to be spoilers.

<details>
<summary>Double Graves</summary>

Every set of two graves have a 1 in 12 chance of being replaced with a double grave. Double graves will spawn two zombie villagers.

## Planned/Upcoming Features

- Graveyards for other village biomes (desert, taiga, snowy, etc.).
- A new illager structure. I do not have specific plans for this, so please tell me your ideas!

## Reposting

So my data pack is posted under the MIT license, which means you can do a lot with it. However, if you include it in a modpack which is distributed on Modrinth, I would appreciate linking back here and/or inviting me to your project and giving me a small portion of the revenue from the project. This is completely volunteer work for me.

You may fork and edit this project as long as the title doesn't have my username, but again, I would appreciate attribution/revenue sharing.

You may not post unedited copies under any circumstances.
